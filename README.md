### About
------

Okidoki is a gamified health app designed to gently motivate you into a more active lifestyle. The app connects to Healthkit on your iPhone and lets you set your daily step goal. Once that is set you will be given a virtual pet or “Doki” to take care of. The aim of the app is to encourage you to keep walking as when you reach your daily goal you are rewarded with currency which can be used to buy new treats and toys for your Doki.

### App Demo
------
In the app you can also take a closer look at your health goals in the stats page, where you can see your progress from the last seven day. If you need to update your daily step goal, you can do so in the user settings. And lastly, you will receive popup notifications reminding you to feed and play with your Doki.
