## About


Okidoki is a gamified health app designed to gently motivate you into a more active lifestyle. The app connects to Healthkit on your iPhone and lets you set your daily step goal. Once that is set you will be given a virtual pet or “Doki” to take care of. The aim of the app is to encourage you to keep walking as when you reach your daily goal you are rewarded with currency which can be used to buy new treats and toys for your Doki. 

Check out our [wiki](https://github.com/CharismaticCarrots/Okidoki/wiki) for more information on how our app works and how we set it up!

Users can spend their carrots in the Doki Mart, where they can purchase toys for their Doki. They can access all of their items in the Doki Pack. Feeding their Doki carrots will increase its fullness, while tapping on a toy will increase its mood.
